# What is ETAG?
The Electronic Transponder Analysis Gateway (ETAG) is a database and software system to provide professional data management and versatile data dissemination to the growing community of researchers who use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to advance biological inquiries in fields like animal behavior, ecological physiology, and community ecology. ETAG is an infrastructure based on open-source tools, allowing scientists to collect, validate, visualize, analyze, and share data in near real-time. ETAG facilitates new capacities both for producing novel science and for sharing data with fellow researchers and the general public. Our system will free up time from the management of data collection, analysis, and curation (currently done by hand), leaving researchers with more time for science. 

# What is RFID?
RFID is a mature and ubiquitous technology, familiar to people in the form of electronic tool-booths or as 'microchip' tags implanted in cats and dogs. RFID entails short-range wireless communication between small transponder tags and readers, and it can facilitate tracking of individual items or animals that are equipped with a tag. A community of researchers has emerged that employs RFID to track individual birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and even insects in a wide range of field and laboratory research endeavors.

# Who should use ETAG?
You should use ETAG if you have RFID reads with associated data on the tagged organisms.

# Why should I use ETAG instead of my own personal data management system?
- Using ETAG's already designed, standardized database will save you time on managing your own database
- ETAG provides several visualizations that can be accessed via API for your lab website or outreach
- Data can be public OR private, allowing you to share data when you're ready.

# How do I use the ETAG website?

General overview and diagram.

## Create a (free!) account

## Upload files

### Manually 

### Legacy data

### Automatically

#### Wired connection

#### Wireless connection

## Download and back up data
You will likely want to download your data both as a backup and to use in local analyses.  We back up your data in xyz ways.


## Visualize data
The ETAG portal offers three filters and two map types.
- Filter by
  - Species
  - RFID reader
  - RFID tag ID
- Map types
  - Summary of counts
  - Map of individual reads

## Connect to your website via API

## Design a RFID antenna
The "Antenna" tab allows you to input parameters and see the resulting RFID antenna.  Please contact Dr. J. Ruyle (ruyle@ou.edu) or Dr. E. Bridge (ebridge@ou.edu) if you have questions about antenna design.
