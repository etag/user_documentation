# What is ETAG?
The Electronic Transponder Analysis Gateway (ETAG) is a database and software system to provide professional data management and versatile data dissemination to the growing community of researchers who use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to advance biological inquiries in fields like animal behavior, ecological physiology, and community ecology. ETAG is an infrastructure based on open-source tools, allowing scientists to collect, validate, visualize, analyze, and share data in near real-time. ETAG facilitates new capacities both for producing novel science and for sharing data with fellow researchers and the general public. Our system will free up time from the management of data collection, analysis, and curation (currently done by hand), leaving researchers with more time for science. 

# What is RFID?
RFID is a mature and ubiquitous technology, familiar to people in the form of electronic tool-booths or as 'microchip' tags implanted in cats and dogs. RFID entails short-range wireless communication between small transponder tags and readers, and it can facilitate tracking of individual items or animals that are equipped with a tag. A community of researchers has emerged that employs RFID to track individual birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and even insects in a wide range of field and laboratory research endeavors.

# Who should use ETAG?
You should use ETAG if you have RFID reads from a scientific study or classroom study with associated data on the tagged organisms.

# Why should I use ETAG instead of my own personal data management system?
- Using ETAG's already designed, standardized database will save you from managing your own database
- ETAG provides several visualizations that can be accessed via API for your lab website or outreach
- Using ETAG leaves you more time to do science instead of managing data
- Data can be public OR private, allowing you to share data when you're ready.
